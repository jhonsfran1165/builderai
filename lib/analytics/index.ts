/**
 * One of the most important thing in a saas is the ability to measure
 * how well is performing. The lack of analytics is always a problem
 * specially for startups that are trying to validate their product.
 * Also build a saas with good analytics is hard and depends on great measure
 * on the features and the nature of the business. That is why I used an opinionated
 * way to track events and pages views. This way you can implement your own provider
 * This library has a lot of plugins if you want to use one of them, but for me tinybird is the most
 * scalable way to do it.
